JBoss AS monitoring module for Zabbix

Author: Igor A. Perminov <igor.a.perminov@gmail.com>
License: GPL v2+

Supported JBoss AS version: 6.0.0.Final


Features

1. Monitoring JBoss AS state via JMX.

2. Low-level discovery and monitoring of following elements:
    * Data sources: managed connection pools (jboss.jca:service=ManagedConnectionPool);
    * Web applications: web managers (jboss.web:type=Manager);
    * HTTP/AJP connectors: global request processors (jboss.web:type=GlobalRequestProcessor)
      and thread pools (jboss.web:type=ThreadPool);
    * Bounded queue thread pools (jboss.threads:type=boundedQueueThreadPool);
    * Queueless thread pool (jboss.threads:type=queuelessThreadPool).

3. Monitoring JBoss AS version and build number.


Installation steps (tested for Ubuntu 14.04)

0. Prerequisites: it is assumed that Zabbix server, Zabbix agent and Zabbix Java gateway
are installed and running.

1. Download and unpack the distribution archive zabbix-jboss-<version>.tar.gz
(replace <version> with the actual version of the module):

    sudo tar xvzf zabbix-jboss-<version>.tar.gz -C /usr/local/share

2. Add user parameters into your Zabbix agent. It can be done in one of the following ways:

a) Copy /usr/local/share/zabbix-jboss/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/userparameter_jboss.conf
into your zabbix_agent.d directory (usually /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d).

    sudo cp /usr/local/share/zabbix-jboss/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/userparameter_jboss.conf /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d

b) Include /usr/local/share/zabbix-jboss/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/ into the configuration
of your Zabbix agent. Typically it can be done by adding the following line
into /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf:

    Include=/usr/local/share/zabbix-jboss/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/

3. Allow "unsafe parameters": it is required to pass '*' in the value of the argument
of the user parameter used to discover JBoss managed objects. To do that specify
in /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf:

    UnsafeUserParameters=1

4. Copy /usr/local/share/zabbix-jboss/etc/zabbix/jboss/* into /etc/zabbix/jboss/
(note: this directory is referenced in scripts and can't be chosen arbitrary)
and disallow other users to peep at JMX credentials in the configuration files:

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/zabbix/jboss
    sudo cp /usr/local/share/zabbix-jboss/etc/zabbix/jboss/* /etc/zabbix/jboss/.
    sudo chown root:zabbix /etc/zabbix/jboss/*
    sudo chmod 640 /etc/zabbix/jboss/*

5. Specify your JBoss AS home directory, JMX binding host/port and JMX user name
in /etc/zabbix/jboss/zabbix-jboss-env.default.sh.

6. Specify your JMX user name (the same as above) and the password in
/etc/zabbix/jboss/zabbix-jboss-jmx.default.login.

7. In case it hasn't been done earlier, specify the JMX user name/password
in the JBoss AS configuration files jmx-console-users.properties and
jmx-console-roles.properties located in <JBoss home>/server/<configuration>/conf/props
(requires JBoss AS restart).

8. Check whether all the above is installed in the right way:

    sudo -u zabbix '/usr/local/share/zabbix-jboss/scripts/zabbix-jboss-jmx-discover.sh' 'jboss.web:type=Manager,*'

In case of success the list of your web application contexts will be printed out
in the JSON format.

9. Restart Zabbix agent:

    sudo service zabbix-agent restart

10. Import the template file /usr/local/share/zabbix-jboss/templates/jboss-as6.xml
into your Zabbix.

11. Link the template "Template JMX JBoss AS 6" to your host (the host should have
a JMX interface having been specified, port 1090).

12. At the host level set values of following macros:

    {$JMX_USERNAME} => the JMX user name
    {$JMX_PASSWORD} => the JMX user password


How to monitor multiple JBoss AS instances

This module allows to monitor multiple JBoss AS instances at the same server.
To do that:

1. Copy zabbix-jboss-env.default.sh and zabbix-jboss-jmx.default.login
into the same directory under the names zabbix-jboss-env.<instance>.sh
and zabbix-jboss-jmx.<instance>.login correspondingly, where <instance>
is an arbitrary chosen name of your JBoss AS instance, e.g. "myjboss2":

    sudo cp /etc/zabbix/jboss/zabbix-jboss-env.default.sh    /etc/zabbix/jboss/zabbix-jboss-env.myjboss2.sh
    sudo cp /etc/zabbix/jboss/zabbix-jboss-jmx.default.login /etc/zabbix/jboss/zabbix-jboss-jmx.myjboss2.login

2. Specify your JBoss AS home directory, JMX binding host/port and JMX user name
and password in the new files.

3. When linking the template "Template JMX JBoss AS 6" to your host, in addition to
{$JMX_USERNAME} and {$JMX_PASSWORD} specify the instance name chosen above
as the value of {$JBOSS_INSTANCE} macro, e.g.:

    {$JBOSS_INSTANCE} => myjboss2


Security issues

The JBoss AS command line utility twiddle.sh, which is used to discover managed
objects, in JBoss AS 6 can accept JMX user name and password as the command line
arguments only (this issue has been fixed in later versions of JBoss AS).
So any local user can see the credentials in the running process list if he/she
can display it at the moment, when the low-level discovery script is running.

So, keep untrusted users out of your server to prevent them from catching
the JMX credentials.
